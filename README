## CLEANING OF DATA
After deciding what data I wanted to look at, I pulled those CSV files and cleaned them using pandas to drop duplicates and nulls. I also preferred to concatenate the two tables, as I was having a hard time using Tableau to merge the two CSV files I needed without losing any data

## CITY OFFICIAL NOTICEABLE TRENDS
Biking is a sustainable resource when used within larger cities. Biknig is the better alternative to getting in a car and sitting in hours of traffic. This was made clear when analyzing our Citi Bike data. I took the months of December 2023 and January 2024 to focus on end of year versus beginning of year trends. You can see a trend where most bike rides start on the coast between Jersey City and New York and mostly end more inland in Jersey City. One hypothesis I can draw from this trend is that many people travel between New York and Jersey often. So many riders get closest to other transportation systems to get to New York and then vice versa to get back to their respective place of settlement. 

## CHRISTMAS WEEK TREND ANALYSIS
When choosing timeframe to look at I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference in the week of Christmas compared to the following month. There was a grand total of 108,931 between December 2023 and January 2024. December 2023 carried 7,945 more rides than the month of January 2024. I wanted to see if the week of Christmas carried the bulk of the difference in rides. I decided to measure the same 10 days in December and January for comparison. After visualizing our data using a line graph we can see that in those 10 days alone December carried 4,556 more rides than January. Which is a little over half of the entire months difference. I hypothesize that this is due to the influx of shopping and getting prepared for gatherings cuasing such an influx in the 10 days of Christmas versus the same 10 days in January. With this we can also note that the amount of rides on Christmas day is the lowest ride count in the month of December, also hinting that most are established and where they want to be the day Christmas comes. As well as the closing of many establihments on this day. 

## E-BIKE VS CLASSIC BIKE ANALYSIS
When looking at ride types I was intrigued to see if there was a preference between types of rides customers are choosing to ride. Therefore I established two maps that show the start ride stations only and filtering their ride choice preference. As well as a representation in a pie chart to show the total amount of e-bike versus classic bike chosen. Overall, it seems that the classic bike is still the preferred choice of bike ride. Altough e-bikes still had several rides, I hypothesize that people prefer to still ride classic bikes as more of a form of excercise rather than just having a bike do the work for you. Knowing the reason behind why someone is choosing the type of bike would give us more clarity and can be done by hosting a survery. As I assume maybe those that take e-bikes mostly use it to commute to work rather than exercise purpose. Also, familiarity might play a role and those that have never used an e-bike just stick with the classic bike as their norm.
